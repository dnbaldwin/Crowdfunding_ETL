# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project_2

This project was done alone (Clinton and I had been paired but had not realised it was designed as a shared task)

The task is incomplete, as I have been unable to load data in to the SQL tables set up by the schema and despite making a number of changes to constraints I have not been successful in getting the tables to load.

As the project is well overdue, I have elected to submit as is.

The jupyter notebook for the project is ETL_Mini_Project_Dbaldwin
